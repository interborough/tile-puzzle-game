# Tile Puzzle Game
A website that allows the user to play a tile swapping puzzle game. Creating using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and a small amount of JQuery. Deployed using Github Pages at the following link: https://interborough.github.io/tile-puzzle-game/

## How to Play
In this game, an image has been cut up into nine pieces, and then each piece is randomly placed into a 3x3 grid. To win the game, you must rearrange the image fragments within the grid to recreate the original image.

To swap the positions of two image fragments, you must click on the checkboxes that coorespond to the images that you wish to swap. Then, once you have two image fragments checked off, you must click the button labeled "SWAP" on the bottom of the page (below the grid). You can only swap the position of two images at a time. 

Once the images are back in their correct order, a message will be displayed informing you that you've won, along with a count of how many times you had to swap the image fragments.

Every time the home page is refreshed the image fragments are rearranged in a random order, providing an almost endless amount of replayability. Have fun!

All of the information in this section is also available on the website itself, and can be accessed by clicking on the "How to Play" tab on the navigation bar of the website. To return to the homepage of the website, click on the puzzle icon in the navigation bar.
