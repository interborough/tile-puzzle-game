    <p>In this game, an image has been cut up into nine pieces, and then each piece is randomly <br> 
      placed into a 3x3 grid. To win the game, you must rearrange the image fragments within the <br>
      grid to recreate the original image. To swap the positions of two image fragments, you must <br>
      click on the checkboxes that coorespond to the images that you wish to swap. Then, once you <br>
      have two image fragments checked off, you must click the button labeled "SWAP" on the bottom <br>
      of the page (below the grid). You can only swap the position of two images at a time. Once the <br>
      images are back in their correct order, a message will be displayed informing you that you've <br>
      won, along with a count of how many times you had to swap the image fragments. Every time the <br>
      home page is refreshed the image fragments are rearranged in a random order, providing an <br>
      almost endless amount of replayability. Have fun!</p>
